This repository contains the analysis and report for **MIS784 Assignment 2**, focusing on **customer behavior analysis** at **MarketCo**, an omnichannel retailer. The analysis leverages data from MarketCo's customer interactions, applying key marketing analytics techniques, such as segmentation, purchase behavior analysis, and communication pattern identification, using SQL queries.

## Project Overview

MarketCo is an omnichannel retailer that strives to enhance customer engagement and optimize sales strategies. This assignment analyzes customer behavior to identify key patterns and provide actionable insights to improve engagement and boost sales.

## Data

The dataset used in this assignment includes two CSV files:
- **Customer Data**: Contains details about customer demographics, communication preferences, and technology usage.
- **Contract Data**: Contains information about customers' contracts, including Gold Memberships and product purchase data.

## Analysis Performed

The analysis includes the following:
1. **Comparison of Gold Members vs. Non-Members**:
   - Examining the purchase frequency, total spending, average spending, and communication patterns between the two groups.
2. **Customer Behavior Patterns**:

3. **Data Gaps**:
   - Identifying missing variables or data that could enhance the analysis.

## Findings
